## Structure
All tasks have been completed in index.js under the comments with corresponding task names. Some additional functionality has been implemented outside of those code blocks and have been commented appropriately. 

## Scenario

The scenario is that we're building a web-based game, and you're joining the development team.  The game is not finished, but we have a basic framework working.

To help you get up to speed with the framework we've stripped out a few bits of code and want you to add them back in so that everything works.  Once you've achieved this you'll be ready to start developing with the rest of the team.

## Run

Unit tests are in the same format.  For this cousework they're in the file `assess.cwk1.js`.  To run the unit tests you should open `index.html`, as usual.  To see the framework for the game without the unit test harness open `game.html`.  In that page, different panels can be toggled on and off with the `D`, `L` and `P` keys. The position of the mouse sets the direction you are traveling in an empty space.
